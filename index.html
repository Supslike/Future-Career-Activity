                    <p>My plans for the future includes being able to finish my studies. And successfully acquiring a job about programming. I didn't originally want to become a programmer, at first, I wanted to become a pilot. But as time passes, my first choices became a programmer, because of my obsession to computers when I was a kid. So as of now my current choices are the following: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Programmer</li>
                        <li>Pilot</li>
                        <li>Businessman</li>
                    </ol>
